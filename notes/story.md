# session 1
It's our big day! We go to the lab.

Professor Weltie reminds us that this league uses a team adventuring format and hands out our pokemon partners and lets us divide into teams:

- team daps (unofficial name)
	- Barley - Dratini
	- Marl - Grookey
	- Dulce - Milcery
	- Adeline - Applin
	- (and Veil - Ghastly)

- team narcs (unofficial name)
	- Velma - Miltank
	- Pippin - Fidough (in ball)
	- Bradley - Geodude (in ball)
	- Annemarie - Rotom (in ball)

Then to kick things off we have a 4v4!

WE LOSE.  Winners get TMs.  Everyone gets healed up.  Bradley's Geodude is the universal heel.

# session 2

Dulce forgot something and ran home, will meet up with us again shortly. As we leave, a young emo with a ghost runs up to join us. Veil was not registered to join the challenge and we let him tag along (with concerns from Adeline).

We head down Route 1. The tall grass is uneventful for us, but afterward we pass two kids talking excitedly about Annemarie and Syrah Sauvignon. Adeline realizes they're playing the story of the ousting. She tries to teach them empathy. We beat them, feel bad and give them some cash for candy, and continue on!

We reach Millville, leveling up to 2.
