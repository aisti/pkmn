# session 1
It's our big day! We go to the lab.

Professor Weltie reminds us that this league uses a team adventuring format and hands out our pokemon partners and lets us divide into teams:

- team daps (unofficial name)
	- Barley - Dratini
	- Marl - Grookey
	- Dulce - Milcery
	- Adeline - Applin

- team narcs (unofficial name)
	- Velma - Miltank
	- Pippin - Fidough (in ball)
	- Bradley - Geodude (in ball)
	- Annemarie - Rotom (in ball)

Then to kick things off we have a 4v4!
WE LOSE.  Winners get TMs.  Everyone gets healed up.  Bradley's Geodude is the universal heel.
